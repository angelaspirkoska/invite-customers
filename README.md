# Invite Customers App

GitHub: https://github.com/angelaspirkoska/invite-customers.git

System requirements: 1. Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version install on your local pc (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 2. Npm - when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your pc 3. Browser - recommended Google Chrome

I am personally finding Visual Studio Code as one of the best for writing Reactjs applications but you can use any other program to check my code. Hope you like it :)
In order to start the project you will first need to install all node modules. Use Command Prompt app and navigate to the folder where you download the project. If you like Visual Studio Code like me, then just open New Terminal from the menu Terminal and run:

### `npm install`

Install all node modules define in package.json file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
